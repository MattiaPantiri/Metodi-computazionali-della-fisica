Hurricane Fay was the first hurricane to make landfall on Bermuda since Emily in nineteen eighty seven. The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the twenty fourteen Atlantic hurricane season, Fay evolved from a broad disturbance several hundred miles northeast of the Lesser Antilles on October ten. Initially a subtropical cyclone with an expansive wind field and asymmetrical cloud field, the storm gradually attained tropical characteristics as it turned north, transitioning into a tropical storm early on October eleven. Despite being plagued by disruptive wind shear for most of its lifetime, Tropical Storm Fay steadily intensified. Veering toward the east, Fay briefly achieved Category one hurricane status while making landfall on Bermuda early on October twelve. Wind shear eventually took its toll on Fay, causing the hurricane to weaken to a tropical storm later that day and degenerate into an open trough early on October thirteen. A few tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued in anticipation of Fay's impact on Bermuda. Despite its modest strength, Fay produced extensive damage on Bermuda. Winds gusting over one hundred miles per hour (one hundred fifty five kilometers per hour) clogged roadways with downed trees and utility poles, and left a majority of the island's electric customers without power. The terminal building at Wade International Airport was flooded after the storm compromised its roof and sprinkler system. Along the coast, the storm unmoored and destroyed numerous boats. Immediately after the hurricane, two hundred Bermuda Regiment soldiers were called to clear debris and assist in initial damage repairs. Cleanup efforts overlapped with preparations for the approach of the stronger Hurricane Gonzalo, which struck the island less than six days later and compounded the damage. Fay and Gonzalo marked the first recorded instance of two Bermuda hurricane landfalls in one season.
