Humans -more specifically, the greenhouse gas emissions we generate -are the leading cause of the earth's rapidly changing climate. Greenhouse gases play an important role in keeping the planet warm enough to inhabit. But the amount of these gases in our atmosphere has skyrocketed in recent decades. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxides "have increased to levels unprecedented in at least the last eight thousand years." Indeed, the atmosphere's share of carbon dioxide -the planet's chief climate change contributor -has risen by forty percent since preindustrial times. The burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas for electricity, heat, and transportation is the primary source of human generated emissions. A second major source is deforestation, which releases sequestered carbon into the air. It's estimated that logging, clear cutting, fires, and other forms of forest degradation contribute up to twenty percent of global carbon emissions. Other human activities that generate air pollution include fertilizer use (a primary source of nitrous oxide emissions), livestock production (cattle, buffalo, sheep, and goats are major methane emitters), and certain industrial processes that release fluorinated gases. Activities like agriculture and road construction can change the reflectivity of the earth's surface, leading to local warming or cooling, too.
